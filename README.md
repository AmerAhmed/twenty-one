# Twenty-one

```
A standard deck of 52 cards is used. The ace is worth 1 or 14 points which is now the most advantageous for the hand in question, a king is worth 13, a queen 12, a jack 11 and other cards his denomination. It is important to get as close to as possible, the sum of 21 on two or more cards.
```

## For instance

```
The hand gives all players a card each from the draw pile. Given does not take any cards herself.
The players now play against the given one at a time in turn. When it's a player's turn, the player requests a card of the given. After the player's second card, any of the following may occur.

The player has got 21 and wins instantly.
The player has five cards in his hand, a sum less than 21 and wins instantly.
The player has cracked, i.e. received a sum greater than 21, and loses immediately.
The player requests additional cards until the sum is 21, has five cards in his hand, sum greater than 21, or declare themselves satisfied.

If a player did not win or lose immediately but instead declared himself satisfied, it is the turn of the dealer to try to punish the player.
The hand pulls cards from the draw pile, one by one, and any of the following may occur:

Given gets 21 and wins.
The deal breaks and the player wins.
Given declares himself satisfied.
The player and the dealer compare the sums of their hands and the one with the highest wins.
If the sums are equal, the given wins.

## Requirement for individual project

```
You will create an individual project, which will be what you are examined on in the course Basic Programming in Python.
To see how the project will be assessed, you have a grade matrix that is in the study guide at PingPong.
To achieve a G, all targets specified as G targets in the matrix must be met. To achieve the grade VG, all goals for G must be met, as well as those marked as VG, ie all goals in the matrix.
Requirements for the project.
You can create a project that is about what you want. It can be a simple game, a register of something you collect, a program that helps you recalculate measurements in recipes if you want to cook for another number of people, for example. Let your imagination run wild.
You will need to implement your project object-oriented. For it to be meaningful, the project must therefore consist of at least three classes. You must also show that you use heredity and polymorphism correctly. This does NOT mean that your project must necessarily contain these, but if appropriate, for the program you are writing, they should be used, and it should be done correctly. Opting out of a technology when it is not suitable for use is also a way to show that you have understood how the technology works.
You will also need to include at least 5 test cases in your project. These need (and should not) be created until we have gone through testing on the lesson.
Submissions
You will make two reconciliation submissions of your project. Dates for these can be found in the course planning in the study guide. These are done in PingPong and you use Git and GitHub to create the submission.
The reconciliation submissions will not be graded, but the purpose of them is that I should be able to see how far you have come, and if I deem it necessary, be able to give you feedback and a push in the right direction. Although these submissions are not graded, they are mandatory. For these, no specific goals need have been achieved, but you submit the project as it looks at the moment.
If you choose to create a private repository on GitHub, you must invite me (ArtheadSweden, joakim@arthead.se) as a participant in the project so that I can access it.
The final submission takes place in the same way. Make sure that all submissions are made on time.

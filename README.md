# Twenty-one

```
A standard deck of 52 cards is used. The ace is worth 1 or 14 points which is now the most advantageous for the hand in question, a king is worth 13, a queen 12, a jack 11 and other cards his denomination. It is important to get as close to as possible, the sum of 21 on two or more cards.

For instance:

The hand gives all players a card each from the draw pile. Given does not take any cards herself.
The players now play against the given one at a time in turn. When it's a player's turn, the player requests a card of the given. After the player's second card, any of the following may occur.

The player has got 21 and wins instantly.
The player has five cards in his hand, a sum less than 21 and wins instantly.
The player has cracked, i.e. received a sum greater than 21, and loses immediately.
The player requests additional cards until the sum is 21, has five cards in his hand, sum greater than 21, or declare themselves satisfied.


If a player did not win or lose immediately but instead declared himself satisfied, it is the turn of the dealer to try to punish the player.
The hand pulls cards from the draw pile, one by one, and any of the following may occur:


Given gets 21 and wins.
The deal breaks and the player wins.
Given declares himself satisfied.
The player and the dealer compare the sums of their hands and the one with the highest wins.
If the sums are equal, the given wins.
